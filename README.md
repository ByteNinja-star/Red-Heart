ðŸ”—**Heart Shape Visualization with Python Turtle**

This project uses the Python Turtle graphics library to create a beautiful heart shape pattern based on parametric equations. The heart is drawn in red against a black background, and it leverages the mathematical functions sine and cosine to plot points in a way that resembles a heart.


ðŸ”—**Features**

Parametric Equation-based Design: The heart shape is generated using mathematical parametric equations.
Turtle Graphics: Utilizes Python's turtle module for drawing the heart on the screen.
Smooth Animation: The heart is drawn point by point in a smooth animation.


ðŸ”—**Prerequisites**

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine along with the turtle library. The math library is also used but comes pre-installed with Python.


ðŸ”—**How to Run**

Clone or download the repository.
Run the Python file using the following command:

python main.py

ðŸ”—**Watch the Turtle graphics window as it draws the heart!**


ðŸ”—**Code Breakdown**

hearta(k) and heartb(k):

These two functions define the parametric equations for the x and y coordinates of the heart shape:

hearta(k): Generates the x-coordinate based on the sine of k.

heartb(k): Generates the y-coordinate based on a combination of cosine terms for different multiples of k.


ðŸ”—**Drawing Logic**

The heart shape is drawn using a for loop that iterates over 6000 points.

Each point is calculated and drawn using Turtle's goto() function, which moves the Turtle to the specified coordinates.

The heart is scaled by multiplying both x and y values by 20 for visibility.

**Colors and Speed**

The heart is drawn in red on a black background for visual contrast.
The drawing speed is set to 0, which means the fastest possible speed in Turtle graphics.
