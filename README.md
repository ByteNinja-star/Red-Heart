**Heart Shape Visualization with Python Turtle**

This project uses the Python Turtle graphics library to create a beautiful heart shape pattern based on parametric equations. The heart is drawn in red against a black background, and it leverages the mathematical functions sine and cosine to plot points in a way that resembles a heart.


**Features**

Parametric Equation-based Design: The heart shape is generated using mathematical parametric equations.
Turtle Graphics: Utilizes Python's turtle module for drawing the heart on the screen.
Smooth Animation: The heart is drawn point by point in a smooth animation.


**Prerequisites**

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine along with the turtle library. The math library is also used but comes pre-installed with Python.


**How to Run**

Clone or download the repository.
Run the Python file using the following command:

python main.py

**Watch the Turtle graphics window as it draws the heart!**
